This project is a show-case of the equally named Gatsby Starter Template *praesto*.
Most information are cited from the *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*.
Selections and markup were done by Michael Czechowski, the author if this template.

## The Idea

Instead of show-casing templates with irrelavent information, this project wants trigger the intrest of the user for philosophy. 

## Want to reach out?

Whether youâ€™re exploring *praesto* or rolling it out across your organization, our team is here for you.
